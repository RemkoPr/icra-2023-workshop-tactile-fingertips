This folder contains 3D CAD designs. The solidworks folder contains .sldprt and .sldasm files for editing in SolidWorks. The stl folder contains .stl files for 3D printing without adjustments. The fingertips come in two versions, rigid and flexible. 

The rigid version (IRTouch_rigid) is a single part, best printed face-side up, so that the PCB slot remains smooth. The flex version consists of two parts, where the mechanical interface (IRTouch_flex_interface) is best printed in rigid material. The other part (IRTouch_flex) is printed with Flexfil 98A, face side down, so no support is needed. 

### Note
The files 2F85-OPENED-NO_FINGER.SLDASM and IO_20Coupling_20UR_20CB_20190807.SLDPRT are pulled straight from the [Robotiq Downloads page](https://robotiq.com/cobot-brands/universal-robots).
