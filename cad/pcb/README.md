This folder contains PCB design files for both the receiver (irtouch_led) as well as the tranmitter (irtouch_rcv) tactile finger. Additionally, the design for the custom breakout flange (robotiq_wrist_coupling) PCB is provided. This PCB is set between the Robotiq I/O Coupling and the 2F-85 gripper itself. The arduino_breakout is a simple PCB to which female 0.1" pin headers are soldered. This PCB fits in the Arduino_holder found in cad/3d.

Refer to the cad/3d folder for an exploded view of the structural integration.
